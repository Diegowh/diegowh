## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer currently working on my personal project WHGG. It's a mobile app (for now) built with Flet and Django. It provides a service for players of an online multiplayer game, giving them access to their in-game profile statistics.

I'm responsible for the planning, development, and future deployment of the app. It's been a challenging and rewarding experience that has taught me how to design complex system using software architecture design patterns, get familiar with API development and management, as well as relational database design and maintenance.

I am open to new challenges, projects and collabs. Do not hesitate to contact me!
